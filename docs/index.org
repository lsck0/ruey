* PLAN
  - [ ] baseline chat client (no logging in)
    - [ ] multiple viewports
      - [ ] always on top support
    - [ ] color theme editor
    - [ ] show badges and emotes
    - [ ] proper message history
  - [ ] being logged in
    - [ ] oauth login flow
    - [ ] twitch pub/sub
    - [ ] sending messages
      - [ ] autocomplete for names
      - [ ] commands (/ban, ...)
    - [ ] performing mod actions
  - [ ] 1.0.0 release
  - [ ] stats tracking
  - [ ] command engine

* BUGS
  - [ ] active searching should hide notices
  - [ ] mod/unmod button broken
  - [ ] relinking account is broken (sometimes?)
  - [ ] Chat export is continuously exporting, change to point in time export and add option for continuous export
  - [ ] Treat "joined channel" as notice in the context of filtering through messages
  - [ ] notif for untimeouting/unbanning? (maybe it comes via pubsub)
  - [ ] hide vip/mod buttons on banned users
