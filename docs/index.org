* PLAN

    - [ ] Chat commands
    - [ ] Twitch Pub/Sub integration
    - [ ] narrow down twtich permissions for oAuth

* BUGS

  - [X] long usernames overflow
  - [ ] active searching should hide notices
  - [ ] mod/unmod button broken
  - [ ] relinking account is broken (sometimes?)
  - [ ] layout is not restored
  - [ ] Clear chat does not mark messages by caster as deleted
  - [ ] Chat export is continuously exporting, change to point in time export and add option for continuous export
  - [ ] Treat "joined channel" as notice in the context of filtering through messages
  - [ ] notif for untimeouting/unbanning? (maybe it comes via pubsub)
  - [ ] hide vip/mod buttons on banned users
